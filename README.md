# booking-chatbot
A chatbot that recreates all the worst chlich√©s of customer service: endless waits, repetitive answers and pointless redirects. Instead of making you angry, it will make you laugh in a pleasantly frustrating way.

## Features
The application lets users chat with an AI booking service that intentionally never reaches users' goal. It does so by parsing system prompts to AI model for each interaction.<br>
The system chooses randomly 1 between 5 system prompts of increasing frustration level for the user. Then it sends the system prompt to the model alongside the user message. <br>
The model responds accordingly, adjusting the frustration level of its answer based on the system prompt.<br>
Front-End simulates waitings and transfers with a timeout and a typical call-center music, triggered by specific keywords in the model's answer.<br>
During the interaction, the chatbot will present two different personalities: the first one is more formal and professional while the second one is more funny and unpredictable.
